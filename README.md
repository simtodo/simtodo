## Why
Have you ever used a Todo app and felt like it was just too much, to many fetures no one uses and a hole load of clutter making it complicted for no reason, well Thats why I made this app. This app is what I wanted from a todo app, something that is simple fast lightweight and private without usless fetures, clutter, telmpetory.
